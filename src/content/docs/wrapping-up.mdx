## What We've Covered

Throughout this workshop, you've gained hands-on experience with Sentry's powerful tracing, logging, and performance monitoring capabilities in a modern JavaScript stack. Let's recap what we've learned:

### 1. Getting Started with Tracing and Logs

We began by setting up comprehensive instrumentation in our fullstack JavaScript application:

- **Vite Frontend Integration**:
  - Configured Sentry with React and Vite
  - Set up browser tracing and session replay
  - Implemented source map uploads for better debugging
  - Created custom spans for user interactions

- **Bun Backend Integration**:
  - Installed and configured Sentry for Bun runtime
  - Set up server-side tracing and profiling
  - Implemented request instrumentation
  - Connected frontend and backend traces

- **Core Tracing Concepts**:
  - Understanding distributed tracing fundamentals
  - Creating and managing span hierarchies
  - Adding structured logging with breadcrumbs
  - Connecting traces across service boundaries

### 2. Instrumenting Span Attributes, Metrics, and Alerts

We enhanced our instrumentation with detailed attributes and custom metrics:

- **Advanced Span Instrumentation**: Added meaningful attributes to spans for better filtering and analysis
- **Custom Metrics**: Implemented business and performance metrics tracking
- **Component-Level Tracking**: Instrumented React components with user interaction spans
- **API Endpoint Monitoring**: Added comprehensive backend request tracking
- **Alert Configuration**: Set up intelligent alerts for performance and error thresholds

### 3. Tracing Database, Queues, and Caches

We instrumented the data layer and background processes:

- **Database Query Monitoring**: Created instrumented database connections with detailed query analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracked query duration, row counts, and connection pool statistics
- **Background Job Processing**: Implemented comprehensive job queue monitoring
- **Cache Instrumentation**: Monitored cache hit rates, performance, and effectiveness
- **Repository Pattern**: Applied instrumentation patterns for clean, maintainable code

### 4. Visualizing Traces in Sentry

We mastered Sentry's visualization and analysis tools:

- **Waterfall Analysis**: Learned to read and interpret trace waterfall charts
- **Performance Debugging**: Used systematic approaches to identify and resolve bottlenecks
- **Custom Dashboards**: Created tailored dashboards for monitoring key metrics
- **Advanced Filtering**: Mastered Sentry's query language for finding specific issues
- **Correlation Analysis**: Connected performance data to business outcomes

## Advanced Techniques Mastered

Throughout these exercises, you've learned sophisticated observability practices:

- **Distributed Tracing**: Tracking requests across multiple services and platforms
- **Performance Profiling**: Using traces to identify N+1 queries, cache misses, and serial operations
- **Custom Instrumentation**: Creating domain-specific spans and metrics
- **Error Context Enrichment**: Adding meaningful context to errors and exceptions
- **Business Intelligence**: Tracking custom metrics that align with business goals
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Setting up alerts and dashboards for early issue detection

## Key Patterns and Best Practices

You've implemented several important patterns:

### Instrumentation Patterns
- **Middleware Pattern**: Automatic request instrumentation
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data layer instrumentation
- **Decorator Pattern**: Wrapping existing functionality with tracing
- **Context Propagation**: Maintaining trace context across async operations

### Performance Optimization
- **Query Optimization**: Using trace data to identify and fix slow queries
- **Cache Strategy**: Optimizing cache usage based on hit rate metrics
- **Parallel Processing**: Identifying and parallelizing sequential operations
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracking memory, CPU, and connection pool usage

### Error Handling
- **Structured Logging**: Adding meaningful context to error events
- **Exception Enrichment**: Including relevant business context in error reports
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handling failures while maintaining observability
