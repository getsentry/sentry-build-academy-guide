</Steps>

## What's Available After Setup

Once you've completed the setup, you'll have access to:

- A Vite-powered React frontend running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- A Bun backend API running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Full-stack JavaScript application ready for Sentry instrumentation

This setup will allow you to progress through the workshop and start implementing tracing, logging, and performance monitoring.

## Next Steps

Once your environment is running, head to the [Getting Started with Tracing and Logs](/tracing-logs/) module to begin instrumenting your application with Sentry.
