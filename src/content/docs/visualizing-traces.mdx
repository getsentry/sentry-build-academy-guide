## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand what Critical Experiences are and why they matter
- Learn how to identify and define Critical Experiences for your application
- Set up comprehensive dashboards to monitor Critical Experiences using Sentry
- Create widgets that track errors, performance metrics, and custom business metrics
- Configure alerts for Critical Experience degradation

## What are Critical Experiences?

Critical Experiences (CX) are specific user journeys or workflows that directly impact your business outcomes. Unlike general application monitoring, Critical Experience monitoring focuses on the end-to-end user flows that drive revenue, user engagement, and business growth.

### Examples of Critical Experiences

**E-commerce Application:**
- User registration and onboarding
- Product search and discovery
- Add to cart and checkout process
- Payment processing
- Order confirmation and tracking

**SaaS Platform:**
- User signup and trial activation
- Core feature usage (dashboard loading, data processing)
- Subscription management
- Billing and payment flows

**Content Platform:**
- Content discovery and search
- Content consumption (video playback, article reading)
- User engagement actions (likes, shares, comments)
- Subscription or premium feature access

### Why Monitor Critical Experiences?

Traditional monitoring focuses on technical metrics like server response times and error rates. Critical Experience monitoring connects these technical metrics to business outcomes by:

1. **Business Impact Focus**: Prioritizes issues that directly affect revenue and user satisfaction
2. **End-to-End Visibility**: Tracks complete user journeys across multiple services and touchpoints
3. **Proactive Problem Detection**: Identifies degradation before it significantly impacts business metrics
4. **Contextual Alerting**: Provides alerts with business context, making it easier to prioritize responses

## Monitoring Critical Experiences with Sentry

Sentry provides powerful tools for monitoring Critical Experiences through:

- **Custom Dashboards**: Visualize CX metrics alongside technical performance data
- **Business Metrics**: Track custom metrics that align with business KPIs
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor errors specifically within critical user flows
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and web vitals for key user interactions
- **Release Tracking**: Understand how deployments impact Critical Experiences

### Setting Up CX Monitoring

The process involves:

1. **Identifying Critical Experiences**: Define the key user flows that drive business value
2. **Instrumenting CX Touchpoints**: Add tracking for errors, performance, and custom metrics
3. **Creating CX Dashboards**: Build dashboards that provide comprehensive CX visibility
4. **Configuring CX Alerts**: Set up alerts for CX degradation

## Sentry Academy Critical Experience Setup

For this workshop, we'll set up monitoring for the Sentry Academy Critical Experience, which includes the key user flows that determine student success and platform engagement.
